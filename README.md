# Udemy Course on MicroServices

This is the first project in the [Course from Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/microservices-with-node-js-and-react/).

## Different
I took a slightly different approach than the Course: 

- Database is not memory but a json db
- Not Docker but docker-compose is used. 

## Starting up
Go to the Deployment folder and type
```bash
./start.sh
```

This will create the Containers and start them using Docker-compose.

## Data
The data is in JSON file located in the ./data directory.
